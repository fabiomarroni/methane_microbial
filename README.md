# methane_microbial
R functions used in our paper **Environmental methane emissions from seagrass wrack and evaluation of salinity effect on microbial community composition**  (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.125426).
Functions should be executed sequentially in numeric order after retrieving 16s metagenomics raw reads. Some tweaking may be (may?!! I bet it will be, sorry!) needed to adapt them to run on your own experimental setting.
If you find them useful for a publication, please cite our paper.
If you need some info, feel free to drop me a line.

# methane_microbial
R functions used in the paper "Environmental methane emissions from seagrass wrack and evaluation of salinity effect on microbial community composition".
Functions should be executed sequentially in numeric order after retrieving 16s metagenomics raw reads. Some tweaking may be (may?!! I bet it will be, sorry!) needed to adapt them to run on your own experimental setting.
If you find them useful for a publication, please cite our paper.
If you need some info, feel free to drop me a line.
